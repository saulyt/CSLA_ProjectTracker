In order to run/debug the Blazor sample.
You need to launch not just the Blazor client, but also the app server project, 
just like you would with the WinForms or WPF apps.

Right-click on the solution, select 'Set Startup Projects'
When dialog appears select the radio button  'Multiple startup Projects'

Set Action for the project 'ProjectTracker.AppServerCore' to 'Start
Also set Action for the project 'ProjectTracker.Ui.Blazor.Client' to 'Start'
